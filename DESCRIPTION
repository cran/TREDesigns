Description: There are some experimental scenarios where each experimental unit receives a sequence of treatments across multiple periods, and treatment effects persist beyond the period of application. It focuses on the construction and calculation of the parametric value of the residual effect designs balanced for carryover effects, also referred to as crossover designs, change-over designs, or repeated measurements designs (Aggarwal and Jha, 2010<doi:10.1080/15598608.2010.10412013>). The primary objective of the package is to generate a new class of Balanced Ternary Residual Effect Designs (BTREDs), balanced for carryover effects tailored explicitly for situations where the number of periods is less than or equal to the number of treatments. In addition, the package provides four new classes of Partially Balanced Ternary Residual Effect Designs (PBTREDs), constructed using incomplete block designs, initial sequences, and rectangular association scheme. In addition, one extra function is included to help study the parametric properties of a given residual effect design.
